## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to do the same thing to data much easier because you can use them to make embedded mini-scripts that do the thing you want in one concise location in your script.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

``` ruby
def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

hello
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

``` ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end


```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

``` ruby
hello_someone("Sam")
```

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

What is a real world application of a Method that I've experienced as a user on AirBnB?
