**Going out on a limb here** and doing a TTD with perspective on a tutorial I tried to follow because this caesar cipher is definitely out of my league right now.

Build Caesar Cipher
 1 define shift method to codify string data set based on shift values provided by the user
   1.1 define a cipher shift method for the user in relation to the string describing and holding the data
       1.1 establish 'string' variable in program
       1.2 establish 'shift' variable in program
           1.2.1 assign alphabet array to define unshifted string data set between 'a' and 'z'
                 1.2.1.1 define that alphabet has a range of 26
                 1.2.1.2 define an array of 26 string data objects that reside at, on and between 'a'..'z'
                 1.2.1.3 index original position of all parts of the alphabet string before initializing data shifting method
                 1.2.1.5 utilize modulo operator to loop array and wrap all shift data back into the definition of the array values
                 1.2.1.6 establish |letter| variable to define alphabet index to its position at or between a..z
                         1.2.1.6.1  

I'm excited to grasp the syntax of this language and its variables in a way that turns them into codifiable language
